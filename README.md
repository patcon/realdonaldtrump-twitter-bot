# Trump Pol.is Twitter Bot

President-Elect Trump's Twitter reply threads seem to be very toxic and
unproductive. [Pol.is](https://pol.is) is a tool that seems great for
facilitating large-scale conversations with minimal moderation.

The bot aims to create a Pol.is conversation for each of President-Elect
Trump's tweets, and tweet it at him for his respondants to participate
in.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/patcon/trump-polis-twitter-bot.git
cd trump-polis-twitter-bot
cp sample.env .env
vim .env
heroku create my-app-name
heroku config:push
git push heroku master
```
