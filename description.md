Well, hello everyone.
I bet you're wondering why I've called this meeting.

Short answer: Because Twitter threads make my head, heart and soul hurt.
And it worries me a little bit.
Aaaand I think you probably agree.
As some guy on Twitter [once said](https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/768994815442694144):

> _If you want a vision of the future, imagine a million tweets talking past one other, forever._

That sounds like hell.

So I've dragged you onto this website.
(Because fuck that future.)
This website runs a tool called Polis.
If you're impatient, scroll down below this boring text, check out the shiny graphics and start clicking and typing as you see fit.

If you want a little more guidance on how to use this, read below this bar.

## About

Polis uses crazy moon math and machine learning to help people have better conversations when more than a handful want to talk at once.
It's basically just a bunch of agree/disagree comments.
But then Polis uses math to visually group people who are agreeing and disagreeing on the same things.
And then we can all explore that information.
This helps us better understand _not only_ where each group agrees and disagrees, but also what **together we all agree on**
(ie. the "Majority Opinion" seen below).
This last bit is really easy to lose sight of.
But it's a pretty important part of not hating one another.

## Basic Instructions

* How to **Vote**
  * If you don't know, or think it's a badly written comment, just _PASS_.
* How to **Comment**
  * Best to view all existing comments before adding new ones.
  * Please click “Share your perspective…” to add your comments.
  * Your "perspective" can be either feelings or facts -- start with "I think..." or "I am..."
  * Comments should be standalone.
    They shouldn't respond to other comments.
  * For complicated perspectives, please split them into simpler comments.
    These will be easier for others to vote on.
  * Do not use questions.
* But what are the **goals**?
  * In a general sense, the goal is understanding our fellow citizens.

_Note:
This system is not for counting the number of people holding each opinion.
It's for understanding both the diverse “opinion groups” and also the “majority opinions” shared by all.
It's about understanding consensus.
People with the same opinions are represented as a single group.
We welcome everyone to share their views._
